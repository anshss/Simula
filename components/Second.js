            Lend us your owned NFT and receive a regular monthly 4% to 7%
            interest. Once you hit the button, your NFT gets transferred into a
            smart contract. A DAO will now be able to access your NFT. It will
            be performing some businesses like renting your NFT to an exhibition
            or a user and yielding interest in it. It will cover the 7% provided
            to you and eventually try to earn more than that. The extra earnings
            of DAO will be divided among its members. A user can become a DAO
            member by stake 5 Matic. After your Lending duration expires, your
            NFT will be returned to you.

            List your NFT as collateral and get a loan up to 40% of NFT value
            from us in USDT. Once you hit the button, your NFT gets transferred
            into a escrow smart contract for the loan duration. Repay the loan
            after the duration with 4% interest in a duration of 1 month. If you
            default, our Dao can foreclose your NFT. Collateral duration can
            vary between 1 month to 4 months. This time period is decided to
            avoid NFT fluctuations. For the same reason, the amount is given in
            USDT.
