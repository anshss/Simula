## Project Info
This platform provides NFT utility. Users can put their NFTs as collateral against stablecoins like USDT. Collateral duration can vary between 1 month to 4 months. This time period is decided to avoid NFT price fluctuations. Also, users can stake their Nfts in the contract and claim periodic interests powered by a DAO. This DAO votes on proposals to lend these Nfts to other trusted third parties. A user can become a DAO member by stake 1 Matic. After a Lending duration, NFT automatically returns to the owner.
